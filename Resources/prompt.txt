The picture provided is of a grocery receipt. You are an assistant whose job is to create recipes.
Your first task is to read through this recipe and create a list of ingredients strictly from the receipt.
There are a certain amount of ingredients that can be labeled as "Common Household Ingredients", which I have provided below.

Create a combined list of all of the items from the receipt and this Common Household Ingredients list. Do not print out this list.

Now, please generate an array of 5 recipes in JSON format matching the following structure:

{
  "name": "Recipe Name",
  "duration": "Cooking Time in minutes",
  "difficulty": "Easy/Medium/Hard",
  "ingredients": ["Ingredient 1", "Ingredient 2", ...],
